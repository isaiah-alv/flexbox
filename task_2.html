   <h1>ISAIAH ALVIOLA</h1>
   <p>In this task, the list items are all different sizes, but we want them to be displayed as three equal sized columns, no matter what content is in each item.</p>
   <ul>
      <li>I am small</li>
      <li>I have more content than the very small item.</li>
      <li>I have lots of content. So much content that I don't know where it is all going to go. I'm glad that CSS is pretty good at dealing with situations where we end up with more words than expected!</li>
    </ul>
